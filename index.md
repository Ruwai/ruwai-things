### Intro

Hello, my name is Chris Louie and this is a collection of my Data Science projects. 

### Data Exploration Projects

#### [Starbucks Nutrition Facts EDA](https://medium.com/@chris.louie/can-a-starbucks-a-day-keep-the-doctor-away-b2b71c4baa70)

> Do you know what's in your Frappuccino? Are you tired of reading boring nutrition labels? Well if you click the link above, you can interact with visualizations of these nutrition facts. Starbucks may not explicitly label the nutrition facts of their products in store, so i've made it easier than browsing through the extensive list of nutrition facts you can find online.

#### [StockX Data Contest 2019](https://github.com/Ruwai/stockx-eda-2019)

![StockX Choropleth Map](https://github.com/Ruwai/stockx-eda-2019/blob/master/stockXMap.gif "StockX Choropleth Map")

> After wrangling features from the dataset, the goal was to visualize where resold Yeezys from StockX were ending up. To do that, I created an interactive choropleth map with a scroll bar to show the monthly change in the amount of resold Yeezys found in a state per 100,000 people. If you highlight over each state in the choropleth map, a pop-up box will appear with the following details: {(The amount of Yeezys Resold per 100,000), (State), (State Population), and (The most purchased Yeezy in the State). Yeezys Resold per Capita is a representation of the amount of Yeezys resold by state divided by the state's population, then multiplied it by 100,000. What I concluded was that one will find the most people with Yeezys bought from StockX in Oregon for every 100,000 people.
